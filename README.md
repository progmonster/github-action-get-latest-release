Get Latest Release
==================

A simple Github action to get the latest release from another repository. No authentication required.


Configuration
=============

Example Repository - https://github.com/pozetroninc/github-action-get-latest-release

**Inputs**

Name | Description | Example
--- | --- | ---
owner | The Github user or organization that owns the repository |  pozetroninc
repo | The repository name | github-action-get-latest-release

**or**
Name | Description | Example
--- | --- | ---
repository | The repository name in full | pozetroninc/github-action-get-latest-release

**Additional Inputs (Optional)**
Name | Description | Example
--- | --- | ---
excludes | Exclude draft or pre-release versions. | "prerelease, draft"
token | GitHub token or personal access token | `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` or `${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}`

Using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` will avoid the action [failing due to hitting API rate limits](https://github.com/pozetroninc/github-action-get-latest-release/issues/24) from the IP address of the GitHub runner your action is running on. Using a `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` is required to get the release information from a private repo. You can read about [how to create a personal access token here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) and how to [add this as a repository secret here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets).

**Outputs**

Name | Description | Example
--- | --- | ---
release | The latest release version tag | v0.3.0
id | The latest release version id | 12345
description | The latest release description body | This is an example release
